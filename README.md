# openrgb_visualizer
a real time FFT visualizer in python which outputs specific hz's and changes colors of your devices using openrgb

I would recommend the *Visual Map* plugin in OpenRGB for this. as the code detects virtual devices.

you can change the code to detect a keyboard or a light strip for example.
